 Name:        OdfEdit
 Purpose:     Application helping to edit an organ definition file (ODF) in plain text
              and permitting to convert a Hauptwerk ODF into GrandOrgue ODF
              The ODF can be used in the GrandOrgue application
              Implemented with Python 3
              Tested in Windows 10 and Ubuntu 21.10
              It is contains 6 classes :
                   C_LOGS to manage the logs generated by the various fonctions of the application
                   C_ODF_DATA_CHECK to check the syntax and the consistency of the edited ODF data
                   C_ODF_DATA to manage the edited ODF data
                   C_ODF_HW2GO to manage the convertion from a Hauptwerk ODF to a GrandOrgue ODF
                   C_GUI to manage the graphical user interface of this application
                   CreateToolTip to display a tool tip on a GUI widget
 Author:      Eric Turpault (France, Châtellerault)
 Copyright:   open source
 Licence:     free to modify, please share the modification with the author

 The considered GrandOrgue ODF syntax is :
    [object_uid]  ; comment
    ; comment line, empty lines are ignored
    ; object_uid can contain only alphanumeric characters
    attribute1=value1  ; comment
    attribute2=value2
    ; attribute can contain only alphanumeric or '_' characters

 The new panel format is detected if the Panel000 object is present and contains the attribute NumberOfGUIElements

 Versions history :
   v1.0 - 15 April 2022 - initial version
   v1.1 - 16 April 2022 - minor changes to be Linux compatible, minor GUI fixes
   v1.2 - 27 April 2022 - some GUI behavior improvements, minor improvements in the help and the objects checks
   v1.3 - 19 May   2022 - data management improvement, change in the way to define the parent-child relations between the objects,
                          completed some attributes values maximum check, added a tab to search a string in the whole ODF
   v2.0 - 23 Dec.  2022 - fix made in the function check_object_Manual around the key_type checks
                          fix made in the function check_attribute_value to not change out of range integer value and better check HTML color code
                          use the PIL library instead of Tk to check the sample set images sizes
                          first implementation of the Hauptwerk to GrandOrgue ODF conversion feature
   v2.1 - 22 Dec.  2023 - HW2GO : fix for files path separator management in various OS
                          HW2GO : get the actual files path/name/extension case from the HW sample set instead of from the HW ODF
                          HW2GO : some design changes without functional impact
                          HW2GO : added general sound stops (blower, bells, ...) and stop action noise support
   v2.2 - 12 Jan. 2023  - HW2GO : improved and more robust way to detect Stop / Coupler / Switch objects to build
                          HW2GO : fix of issues observed with some newly tested HW sample sets
                          HW2GO : added support of HW continuous control and enclosure objects, converted into GO enclosure objects
                          GUI : graphical user interface rework with resizable width for lists and notebook areas
                          GUI : Organ object placed systematically at the top of the objects list
   v2.3 - 08 April 2023 - fix for help text not loaded with Windows OdfEdit.exe (fix in file Help.txt due to characters 0x81 not supported by unicode format)
                          add the support of comments at the end of the lines in the ODF
                          add the support of the separator / in the files path in the ODF
                          improved display and selection of parents/children objects of the selected object
                          improved several behaviors in the GUI management
                          ODF saving in a file places the objects by alphabetical UID order, but Header and Organ which are placed in first position
                          new buttons to add, link to parents/children or rename an object, with automatical update of the object referencing
                             and the total number in other objects, new panel format only is supported
                          HW2GO : visual elements of the main panel are now defined in Panel999Element999 objects
                          HW2GO : Switches have by default StoreInDivisional=Y, StoreInGeneral=Y, GCState=0
                          HW2GO : added a menu item checkbox to ask to convert to GO ranks the HW ranks not used by OdfEdit
   v2.4 -               - objects having child(ren) cannot be deleted with the button Delete
                          added a menu item checkbox to select the file format to use when saving an ODF (ISO_8859_1 or UTF-8 BOM)
                          added a menu item checkbox to disable the automatic objects tree expand on object selection
                          added a menu item checkbox to enable the wave based tremulants convertion from HW to GO
                          added a menu item checkbox to enable the unused ranks convertion from HW to GO
                          configuration data of the application (last ODF folder, options of the menu) are saved in a file OdfEdit.cfg
                          improvements made in the objects list/tree behavior on object selection or change
                          the parents/children of the selected object can be selected and edited in the central list (above the text editor)
                          a double-click on a parent/child object makes it the selected object in the list/tree
                          ctrl+s keys permits to save changes in the edited object and to save changed data in the ODF
                          escape key permits to close the pop-up windows permitting to select parent/children objects
                          added the possiblity to search a text inside the loaded HW ODF
                          HW2GO : removed the attribute AcceptRetuning=N in ranks of pipes
                          HW2GO : pitch tuning attribute used for pipes which the sample has a different native frequency
                          HW2GO : convert the conditional switches (switches which the state depends on the state of other switches)
                          HW2GO : convert the synthetized and wave based tremulants
                          HW2GO : the stop and coupler objects are numeroted according to the manual number to which they belong to
                          several bugs fixing as at each release
TO DO in next releases :
    manage drap-and-drop action on an object in the lists/tree to move it under another parent object
    add a manual compass extension feature
